- 👋 Hi, I’m @IlindaI this is my first day and I'm ready to be ready. I'm hoping that there's more of you in search of the same thing and 
Are up to the task at hand! Cheer and laughter are a key element for this hope to succeed. My love and faith for God are the
Most important parts of me in hopes that others will decide it's worth the struggle of putting Him 1st.
- 👀 I’m interested in the love that was to save the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the truth of the crucifixtion of Jesus Christ, my Lord and savior.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on comparing revelations from my studies and research of the Holy Scripture,
2 Timothy 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong 
in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.
Romans 15:4 For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the 
encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
Deuteronomy 19:21 You must show no pity for the guilty! Your rule should be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
foot for foot.
- 📫 How to reach me ... It's crucial that we remember that God is love and he let us nail His son on a cross
For our sins even as we were and are still sinners. The word is "FOR"!!!!
